  storyText: '2 Day:


    We send charles...or at least I though his name was charles out into the corridor
    to scavenge for anything usefull. After 4 hours of waiting we finally heard a
    something, allthough it wasnt pleasant to hear. Quiet screams could be heard coming
    from the corridor outside and the sound of flesh being torn...


    As the sounds died down we opened the door to find a handgun with 2 bullets, charles
    must have not been so lucky....Whatever is out there clearly knows how to kill,
    but we cant sit there wasting the few resources that we have we need to scavenge,
    or kill that damm thing before it gets its next meal!


    1. Hunt

    2. scavenge
